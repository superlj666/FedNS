# Code for the paper titled "FedNS: A Fast Sketching Newton-type Algorithm for Federated Learning"

This paper has been accepted at AAAI 2024. The code is based on [FedNew](https://github.com/aelgabli/FedNew), implemented by Matlab.

### Experiments
- Run `run_comparison.m` to conduct experiments for the performance of related algorithms w.r.t. the communication rounds.
- Run `run_sketch_size.m` to conduct experiments on the influence of the sketch size for FedNS and FedNDES.
